# Requirements
## Introduction
 My goal in this project is to create a excel file and inside this excel file i will create 5 different sheets. 
 These 5 sheet will have 40 rows and 10 coloumn each.In each of these five sheet i have kept one coloumn same.
 my excel file contain the data of crimes in India from 2001 to 2005.
 I am using python programming to read, write and preform specific action according to user. 
 

## Research

**Using Various Python method to work on data available on 5 different sheets.**

## Defining Our System
    My excel sheet contain the coloumn such as:
    1.Area name
    2.Year
    3.Group name
    4.Sub group name
    5.Case property recoverd
    6.case property stolen, etc.
    My code will read the different sheet from the excel file and after reading the sheet,
    it will extract the specific data which user wants to extract,
    and after  extraction it will write that data in the mastersheet created in the same excel file.

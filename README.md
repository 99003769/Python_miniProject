# Python_miniProject
Aim of this project is to extract the data present in 5 different spreadsheets in one excel file as required by the user. The excel sheet consists of 5 different  spreadsheets.
The user defines the data that needs to be searched on the basis of Area Name. The python program then reads the data corresponding to the particular data from different spreadsheets of excel. It then creates a mastersheet and adds the data from all the sheets to it. In the end, it will plot the bar graph from the data present in the mastersheet.


# Problem Statement:-


In microsoft excel sheet is often called as worksheet. A sheet is a single page that contains its own collection of cells help us to organize data.
Excel spreadsheets do well for small datasets and for a reduced pool of data operations. However, when the projects become bigger and require more sophisticated data operations, than it becomes very hard to work on that data manually. 
several methods have been proposed in order to combat this.
one is to handel datasheet through python programming.
Our problem is We have to create 1 excel file and under that excel file there should be 5 sheets, each sheet should contain 40 rows and 10 columns.
we have to read all 5 sheet and after reading we have to extract specific data every time according to the user input and than write that data in the mastersheet in same excel.
